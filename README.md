# 🎓 Student Risk & Wellness Dashboard (Power BI Academic Project)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧭 Overview

This project aims to analyze mental health risk patterns among students using data visualization and analytics in Power BI.
The dashboard provides insights into depression risk categories, contributing factors, and demographic influences - enabling educational institutions to take data-driven steps to promote student wellness and reduce mental health risks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Project Requirement

The primary goal was to identify underlying causes of rising depression rates among students, such as:

- Academic Pressure

- Lifestyle Choices

- Financial Challenges

- Family Circumstances

By leveraging the dataset and visualization techniques, the analysis helps institutions understand at-risk student segments and develop targeted mental health interventions.

## 📂 Dataset Description

File: student_depression_dataset.csv  [https://github.com/ankitaanand96/student-risk-and-wellness-dashboard-powerbi-academic-project/blob/main/student_depression_dataset.csv]

Rows: 27,880

Columns: 15

Key Features:

- Gender – Male/Female

- Age – Student’s age

- Degree – Educational qualification (e.g., B.Tech, MBA, PhD)

- SleepDuration – Hours of sleep per day

- Work/StudyHours – Total academic hours per day

- FinancialStress, AcademicPressure, FamilyIssues – Rated indicators (1–5 scale)

- RiskCategory – Final mental health risk classification (Low, Moderate, High, Extreme)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Objectives

- Classify students based on mental health risk level.

- Identify key stress drivers using visual analytics.

- Compare risk distribution across gender, age, and education level.

- Analyze correlations between study habits and depression risk.

- Provide actionable insights to support academic well-being initiatives.

## 📊 Dashboard Features & Visuals

Visualization	Description	Key Insight:[https://github.com/ankitaanand96/student-risk-and-wellness-dashboard-powerbi-academic-project/blob/main/student_depression_dashboard_image.jpg]

- KPI Cards	Total Students (27,880), High-Risk % (0.40), Total Cities (52), Degree Count (28)	Overview of dataset coverage and wellness summary.

- Donut Chart – Total Students by RiskCategory	Shows proportion of students by risk level	~90% of students fall under Moderate or High Risk.

- Line Chart – Avg Risk Score by Age Group	Tracks average risk level by age	Risk peaks among 21–25 age group, drops slightly after 25.

- Heatmap – Age × Degree × Avg Risk Score	Displays multi-dimensional relationship	Bachelor & Master’s students aged 21–25 show highest risk.

- Bar Chart – Extreme Risk by DegreeGroup & Gender	Compares extreme risk count by gender and qualification	Male students in Bachelor’s programs are most vulnerable.

- Bar Chart – Work/Study Hours vs RiskCategory	Shows correlation between workload and risk	Longer study/work hours (>8) link with higher risk levels.

- Map – Sum of Risk_score by City	Geographic view of student risk	Certain high-density cities report elevated depression scores.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Insights

1. Risk Distribution:
Over half of students (≈50%) fall under the Moderate risk category, followed by High risk (≈40%) — signaling a concerning trend.

2. Demographic Patterns:
The 21–25 age group and Bachelor’s students show the highest average risk scores.

3. Gender Insights:
Male students exhibit slightly higher extreme risk counts across most degree groups.

4. Lifestyle Influence:
Reduced sleep (<6 hrs/day) and excessive academic workload significantly increase risk scores.

5. Regional Findings:
High-risk clusters are visible in urban academic hubs such as Bangalore, Chennai, and Delhi.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Project Recommendations

1. Implement mental health programs targeting 21–25-year-olds in Bachelor’s programs.

2. Encourage balanced schedules to manage work/study pressure and sleep deprivation.

3. Deploy wellness tracking systems to monitor early warning signs among at-risk groups.

4. Partner with counseling services and student wellness bodies for intervention programs.
